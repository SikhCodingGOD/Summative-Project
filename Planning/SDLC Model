Our project will be using the iterative model to create our application. 
We chose this model because it is the best for a team to work with. 
The reason why we believe this is because as each of us make a part of the code we will need some wortk on existing code to implement the new code.
Unlike the waterfall method we are able to advance and return if adaptation is needed to the existing code we had written. 
As Jovin and I are not always together when we are coding this will help us blend the seperate code qwe are making and make our 1 final model.
See diagram "SDLC Diagram for the steps we will be following.
