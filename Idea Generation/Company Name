Our Company Name decision:
We decided to use 'Long and Short' as our company name because it is a pun.
Long and short describe Connor and myself because I am taller than he is. Also, long and short are data types
used when coding. These idea were made in collaberation as a team bonding activity.
This helps teams feel more comfortable with the end goal being to work better together.
