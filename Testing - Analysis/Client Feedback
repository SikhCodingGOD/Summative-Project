Client --> Dave (Connor's Uncle) 

Good:
- Loved the GUI setup
- Said it was a create way to store passwords
- Liked the warning messages when a text box is left empty

Improve:
- Wanted an option to completely delete a password
- Asked if the program could generate strong passwords that he could use

We are going to create two more buttons on the main window which will lead to two new windows:
1. A window where you can use to delete a password for a specific website
2. A window where you can generate a strong password for a length of your choosing and a button to copy that password to your clipboard
