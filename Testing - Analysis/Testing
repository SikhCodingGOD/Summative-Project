Test 1:
- problems with return button --> the main menu size is different that originally when it is returned to
- program keeps asking for a security question to be chosen even when a question has already been chosen

Solution:
- had to change the JFrame code to keep the size of the main menu the same when the return button is used
- fixed an error in the if else statement. Now, when a security question has already been chose, you have to correctly
answer that question to gain access to the program

Test 2:
- delete button on delete window is deleting ALL the passwords, not just the chosen password

Solution:
- Changed the code for the file writer so it rewrites all the passwords to the file except for the one chosen to be deleted. Before,
the writer was rewriting spaces instead of the actual passwords
