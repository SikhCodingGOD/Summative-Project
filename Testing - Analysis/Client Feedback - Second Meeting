Dave was thrilled that we added the two new windows like he asked!

- For the random password generator, Dave said some websites don't allow passwords with special characters

What we are going to do:
1. We will add an option to generate a password with or without special characters
2. We had an idea which Dave liked, the idea is to added "Return" buttons to each window in case you accidentally hit the wrong button
on the main window.
